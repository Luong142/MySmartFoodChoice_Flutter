Plan for Adding Multiple Dishes to a Meal

    Use a RecyclerView for Dishes: Instead of a ListView, use a RecyclerView for displaying the list of dishes in a meal.
    This choice provides more flexibility and efficiency, especially for dynamic content.

    Custom Layout for Each Dish: Create a custom layout for each dish item in the RecyclerView.
    This layout should include the dish name and a remove button, allowing users to easily add or remove dishes from the meal.

    Update the Meal Model: Modify the Meal model to include a list of FoodItem.Item objects.
    This change allows the Meal model to represent multiple dishes within a single meal entry.

    Implement the RecyclerView in Your Fragment: Set up the RecyclerView in your UserLogMealNutritionAnalysisFragment,
    including the adapter for managing the list of dishes and handling the addition and removal of dishes.

Suggestions for the "Add Dish" Button

    Separate Section for Adding Dishes: Consider creating a separate section at the top or bottom of
    the screen dedicated to adding dishes. This could include the "Add Dish" button and possibly instructions for users.

    Floating Action Button (FAB): If space is limited, using a Floating Action Button (FAB) for the
    "Add Dish" action could be a practical solution. FABs are designed for primary actions and can be placed in a corner of the screen for easy access.

    Modal Dialog or Bottom Sheet: Another approach could be to use a modal dialog or a bottom sheet for adding dishes.
    This provides a clean interface for selecting and adding dishes without cluttering the main screen.

    Navigation Drawer or Menu: If your app has a navigation drawer or a menu, you could include an option to add dishes there.
    This keeps the main screen clean and provides a dedicated place for users to manage their dishes.
